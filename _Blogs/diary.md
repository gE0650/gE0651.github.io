# 9.27

Participated in a Linux ~~Inpart~~ Install Party and Freshman Parties for both gE's faculty and its province. Indeed all are brillant, yet its(gE will be referred to with "it" in this diary) **sense of engagement** was lost, due to its style maybe.  

For long a complaint haunted in gE that maybe what it has been studying **doesn't make a difference**. But today it finds out a positive perspective: Turns out that the courses should be handy.  

Everything felt boring for gE, so it sought for advice from **rW**, who commented *BAK*. It decided to give it a try.  

~~Damn~~ gE's Eng is so awful.

# 9.28

First time to connect to Clab from VScode, which enable using GUI inside VScode. Really helpful for beginners like gE. But now it needs to ssh to Clab first, then ssh again to Github.  

Found a plugin that can change the background of VSC, interesting.  

# 9.29

Trapped by mathematical analysis, did nothing interesting.  
Damn why hasn't gE modify the CV page?  

# 9.30

Installed *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*, plan to give it a try during the vacation.    
Took a small bite of Vim today. Really uncomfortable for beginners like gE, as is declared in many instructions.  

# 10.1

Been back to gE's hometown, felt as if gE just left here days ago. One moment after scrolling for a while it even occurred whether all about the university was a dream and it was still preparing for the exam.  
Kind of blank at what to do next, maybe gE has to list what to do, or maybe it simply needs to rest.  
Found an interesting fact: when pressing **J** and **K** in markdown files, the prompt will go up/down para by para, not line by line. So how should gE reach the lines inside the paras?  
Retrospected what gE'd done. Seemed like lots of things.  

# 10.2

Scrolling all day and did nothing $\ldots$

# 10.3

Still inactive, but learnt some $L^AT_EX$.  
Give it a try here  
$$
\sum^n_{i = 1}i = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}
$$
Seems OK, but gE wonder if it needs to config LaTeX support on this static website generator.  

# 10.4

Did nothing again $\ldots$  
But had a pleasant talk with a friend. Found so huge the gaps between faculties are. So decided to write a handout to share some good stuffs gE've found, also as practice for using $L^AT_EX$.  

# 10.5
 
Finished the first draft of the leaflet, tons of modifications are needed, but compiling is surprisingly EZ.  
Maybe gE needs to get down on some concrete works $\ldots$

# 10.6

Took a small bite of Obsidian and Simpread. Wonder in which scene can gE use them. Do it require gE to take notes in Markdown?

# 10.7

Back to campus, and found itself just missing the anniversary celebration of its high school $\ldots$  
Took a small bite of datalab, which seemed not so difficult as expected.  
Back to the topic of Obsidian, gE found itself equipped with tools to improve efficiency but lack projects to put them into use.  
Still blank about what to do, no assignment from outside, maybe gE has to be proactive.
